[**Mastering OOP: A Practical Guide To Inheritance, Interfaces, And Abstract Classes**](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/11/guide-oop-inheritance-interfaces-abstract-classes/)

*Quick Summary: Arguably the worst way to teach the fundamentals of programming, is to describe what something is, without mention of how or when to use it. In this article, Ryan M. Kay discusses three core concepts in OOP in the least ambiguous terms so that you may never again wonder when to use inheritance, interfaces, or abstract classes. Code examples provided are in Java with some references to Android, but only basic knowledge of Java is required to follow along.*
