**Bio:** I'm a self-taught developer from the Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada. After a brief and uninpsiring two classes of programming in highschool, I set out to create and sell my own Android applications in the summer of 2014. Two years later, after being fed up with poor quality documentation and tutorials present for the platform, I decided to start creating my own educational content as well. 

As I created larger and more complicated applications, I began to branch out into topics in computer science which I felt ignorant of due to my self-directed and very practically oriented studies. I also found out that software architecture is one area in this field which is easy and natural to me. Wanting to give back to the open source and free education communities, I now spend roughly half my time coding, and half my time creating educational content.

 Since 2016, I have created nearly 400 video tutorials, over 5 full length video courses (Several featured on the largest programming channel on youtube, FreeCodeCamp), written 30+ articles (several featured on Smashing Magazine and FreeCodeCamp), and have even taught a class of developers live. I also frequently livestream the creation of new products in order to show individuals exactly how software development is done, and to provide a place where beginners and intermediates can ask questions and get straight forward answers.
