Is it Canadian App:

# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: April 2, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the "Is it Canadian Search App", developed by Ryan M. Kay, collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the App. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Data
The App collects the following personal or sensitive information:
- **Google Sign-In Data**: The App uses Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In as the only login method. When you sign in with your Google account, we collect:
  - Your Firebase User ID (UID), a unique identifier generated by Firebase.
  - Your email address, which is not stored or processed beyond what is required for Firebase Authentication to facilitate sign-in.
- **Customer Account Data**: Upon sign-in, we create a customer account in our Firestore database. This account stores:
  - Your Firebase UID.
  - Additional prompt usage fields with no connection to your personal details (e.g., a generic identifier or preference unrelated to your identity).

### Non-Personal Data
- **Search Queries**: The App stores search queries you enter to improve functionality and performance. These queries are not linked to your Firebase UID, email, or any other identifying information.
- **Device Information**: We may collect basic device details such as device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers (e.g., Android ID) to ensure the App functions properly.
- **Usage Data**: We collect anonymized data about how you interact with the App, such as feature usage and session duration, to enhance the user experience.
- **Crash Reports**: If the App crashes, we may collect anonymized crash logs via Firebase Crashlytics to identify and fix issues.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Authenticate you via Google Sign-In and manage your account using Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
- Provide, maintain, and improve the App’s functionality and performance.
- Analyze anonymized search queries and usage trends to enhance the App’s features and quality.
- Diagnose and fix technical issues.

## Sharing Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share data in the following cases:
- **Service Providers**: We use Google Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, and Crashlytics) to manage authentication, store account data, and monitor app performance. Your email and UID are processed by Firebase Authentication as part of the sign-in process. See Google’s Privacy Policy [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details.
- **Metrics Sharing**: Anonymized search query data may be shared with third parties (e.g., analytics partners) as metrics to improve the App’s quality. No user-identifiable information (e.g., UID, email) will be included in this sharing.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, safety, or property.

## Third-Party Services

The App integrates the following third-party tools:
- **Firebase Authentication**: Used for Google Sign-In. Your email and UID are processed by Firebase. See [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Firebase Firestore**: Used to store your customer account data (UID and a non-personal field).
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: Used to collect anonymized crash reports. See [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Storage and Security

- Your Firebase UID and customer account data are stored securely in Firebase Firestore.
- Your email is stored in Firebase Authentication but is not accessed or stored by the App beyond sign-in.
- Search queries are stored separately in an anonymized format and are not linked to your account.
- We implement reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Choices

- **Account Deletion**: The App provides an option to delete your customer account data from the Firestore collection. This will remove your UID and associated non-personal field. Note that your email and UID may remain in Firebase Authentication until you delete your Firebase account via Google’s services.
- **Uninstalling**: Uninstalling the App will stop all data collection by the App on your device.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn such data has been collected, we will delete it promptly.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
