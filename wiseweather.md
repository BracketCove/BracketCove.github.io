wiseWeather is a simple Weather application which reads the device's current location in order to display immediate local weather just by opening the app. 

**What kind of data is read by the app?**
Via the Fused Location Client which is a part of Google Play Services, the user's coarse location is necessary for the app to function. 

**What does the app do with this location data?**
The location data, specifically and ONLY the device's latitude and longitude, are shared over the network with a 3rd party API (web application), openweathermap.org, which responds with weather information at that particular location. 

**Does the app store this data?**
The app may temporarily cache the location data and weather information for up to one hour in memory. Caching is handled by the operating system (onSaveInstanceState). The data is never stored long term, and only cached to improve user experience and reduce unnecessary network usage.

This application was created and is maintained by Ryan Michael Kay (BracketCove on Google Play Store). For further information, you may direct inquiries to bracket.cove@gmail.com.
